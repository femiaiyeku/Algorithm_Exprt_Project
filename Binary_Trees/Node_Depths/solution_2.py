"""


he distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the node's depth. 
rite a function that takes in a Binar1 Tree and returns the sum of its nodesÂ· depths. 
ach BinaryTree node has an integer value , a left child node, and a right child node. Children nodes can either be Bi naryTree nodes themselves or None I nulL


Sample Input
tree =  1
         /  \
        2    3
         / \  / \
        4  5 6  7
         / \
        8   9

Sample Output
16

// The depth of the node with value 2 is 1.
// The depth of the node with value 3 is 1.
// The depth of the node with value 4 is 2.
// The depth of the node with value 5 is 2.
// Etc..

// Summing all of these depths yields 16.
